👋 Hi, I’m Victoria Ramírez López
- 👀 I’m interested in metabollic modelling, genome-scale metabolic networks, systems biology and the developing field of cultivated meat... and meditation.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 I’m looking to collaborate on building tools for the field of cultivated meat, helping maintain open source libraries for systems biology or curating metabolic models.
