- 👋 Hi, I’m @victoriarl
- 👀 I’m interested in metabollic modelling, genome-scale metabolic networks, systems biology and the developing field of cultivated meat... and meditation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building tools for the field of cultivated meat, helping maintain open source libraries for systems biology or curating metabolic models.
- 📫 If you're interested in collaborating you can reach me through my email ramirezvicky4@gmail.com
